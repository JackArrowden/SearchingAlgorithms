# SearchingAlgorithms
This project covers on 7 main searching algorithms on AI topic: Breadth-first search (BFS), Tree-search Depth-first search (DFS), Uniform-cost search (UCS), Iterative deepening search (IDS), Greedy best-first search (GBFS), Graph-search A* (A*), Hill-climbing (HC). It takes an input file as a test case and performs all 7 algorithms to search
- If the path can not be found, the algorithms will return -1
- If the path is found, the algorithms will return the path from the initial state to the goal state
